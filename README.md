# music-metadata

**play_around_w_itunes_metadata.R**: R script for producing the same sort of end-of-year listening summary Spotify gives you using iTunes metadata (assuming user is a dweeb who resets all of their play counts at the beginning of the year) 

**pRklife.R**: first experiment with spotifyr package--try to generate a playlist of Blur members' post-Blur music based on similarity to groups of Blur songs. Def intend to expand this to better allow user input of song preferences

**pRklife**: a so far super basic Shiny app (still trying to get authentication to work for server version)
