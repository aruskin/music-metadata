**Note:** to run this on your own, you will need a Client ID and Client Secret for the Spotify Web API which you can get by setting up a Dev account [here](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications). You can then set those up in the R environment with the `Sys.setenv()` function (i.e. `Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxâ€™)` and `Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')`) or by creating a text file called .Renviron in the working directory with lines for `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. 

**Data:** We pull data from the Spotify API for all of the Blur, Graham Coxon, Damon Albarn, Gorillaz, and The Good, The Bad, & The Queen albums (we are...ignoring Fat Les).

**Analysis:** The recommendation system here is just using kNN with the numeric audio features (e.g. 'danceability', 'valence', 'energy'--who knows how these features were initially derived) from Spotify to find the 'closest' non-Blur tracks by Blur members to the Blur tracks selected by the user. 

We display the 3 most similar tracks for each selected track and then non-deterministically generate a playlist from a larger pool of the most similar tracks for each track. We grab the 10 closest tracks for each of the user's selections to create a pool (of up to 40 tracks, but likely less because of overlap), randomly select an initial track from that pool, and build a playlist of up to 20 tracks from that pool trying to follow the super basic harmonic mixing theory outlined [here](https://mixedinkey.com/harmonic-mixing-guide/).
