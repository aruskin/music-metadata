**Note:** to run this on your own, you will need a Client ID and Client Secret for the Spotify Web API which you can get by setting up a Dev account [here](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications). You can then set those up in the R environment with the `Sys.setenv()` function (i.e. `Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxâ€™)` and `Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')`) or by creating a text file called .Renviron in the working directory with lines for `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. 

**Data:** We pulled data from Spotify for all of the Blur, Graham Coxon, Damon Albarn, Gorillaz, and The Good, The Bad, & The Queen albums (we are...ignoring Fat Les) and saved that as a csv; it would be pretty inefficient to repull this information from Spotify every time someone runs the app and the fields we're using shouldn't change over time. The dataset would need to be updated whenever one of the former Blur members releases a new album.

**Analysis:** The recommendation system here is just using kNN with the numeric audio features (e.g. 'danceability', 'valence', 'energy'--who knows how these features were initially derived) from Spotify to find the 'closest' non-Blur tracks by Blur members to the Blur tracks selected by the user. 

We display the 3 most similar tracks for each selected track and then non-deterministically generate a playlist from a larger pool of the most similar tracks for each track. We grab the 10 closest tracks for each of the user's selections to create a pool (of up to 40 tracks, but likely less because of overlap), randomly select an initial track from that pool, and build a playlist of up to 20 tracks from that pool trying to follow the super basic harmonic mixing theory outlined [here](https://mixedinkey.com/harmonic-mixing-guide/).
